Overview: The Gravity Calculator class calculates the acceleration due to gravity at a given height above Earth's surface using the gravitational force formula. It incorporates the universal gravitational constant, Earth's mass, and Earth's radius to determine the gravitational acceleration.

formulas: Uses  g=G.M/(R+height)^2 formula to calculate acceleration



process: Calculates the acceleration due to gravity at a specified height above Earth's surface by using above formula taken in class with double datatype


height: Height above the Earth's surface in meters.
Returns: Gravitational acceleration in m/sÂ².
Error Handling: If height is negative, it displays an error message and returns 0

problem faced: 1. error in return when height is negative.
               2. had to find suitable datatype 
               3. problem implementing formula in code 
               4. error while using universal values(G,M,R)
